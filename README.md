# Kometa Config Files

These are my config files for [Kometa](https://github.com/Kometa-Team/Kometa) (formerly PMM, Plex-Meta-Manager).

## Basics

I run the nightly branch of Kometa. Make sure to have at least version 2.0.2-build25.

### Included

* config.yml -> Kometa Config File
* money_heist.yml -> Metadata for the show "Money Heist (2017)" in Netflix Order
* movies.yml -> Movie Collections
* playlists.yml -> Playlists
* tv.yml -> TV Show Collections

All files are available in German (DE) and English (EN). Feel free to ask me questions via Discord or make suggestions on what I need to add here.

## Install

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsFelixH/kometa-config
```

## Usage

Setup Kometa & create your config file . For help refer to the [Kometa Wiki](https://kometa.wiki/).
